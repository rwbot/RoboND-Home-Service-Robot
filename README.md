# RoboND-PathPlanning
Comprehensive capstone for theAutonomous navigation project, where the problem is to implement all 3 steps of autonomous navigation: Perception, Mapping and Localization, Response/Path Planning.

* Created and configured ROS packages to create an autonomous agent that can navigate a simulated house environment. 
* Modeled a virtual environment using the Gazebo simulator 
* Mapped the virtual environment by performing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using the gmapping ROS package. 
* Used AMCL to enable the robot to localize itself within the generated map. 
* Created markers in Rviz to visualize waypoints used as destinations to which the robot must navigate.
