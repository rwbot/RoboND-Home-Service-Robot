# RoboND-PathPlanning
A wall_follower ROS C++ node for the Home Service Robot Project. This node autonomously drives your robot close to the walls while avoiding obstacles on its path and transporting objects. Implemented 

* Created and configured ROS packages to create an autonomous agent that can navigate a simulated house environment. 
* Modeled a virtual environment using the Gazebo simulator 
* Mapped the virtual environment by performing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using the gmapping ROS package. 
* Used AMCL to enable the robot to localize itself within the generated map. 
* Created markers in Rviz to visualize waypoints used as destinations to which the robot must navigate.
